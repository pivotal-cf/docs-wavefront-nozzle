## Contributing to the Documentation

The docs team prefers to receive documentation contributions as pull requests rather than having engineering teams push directly to the docs repos.
This gives us a chance to review the changes for consistency and understand the new content.
For more information, see [Creating a PR](https://docs-wiki.sc2-04-pcf1-apps.oc.vmware.com/wiki/external/create-pr.html)
in the _VMware Tanzu Docs Wiki._

If you are planning to initiate a large documentation effort, please coordinate with the docs team in advance to make sure we're not going to step on each other.
You can reach the docs team by Slack at #pcf-services-docs.
